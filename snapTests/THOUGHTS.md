Tracking descent into madness
-----------------------------

 - "Plugin" based system whereby async providers populate storage pools until
    told not to.
 - Grab screenshot **details** and cache them as we cannot access the local
   information for screenshots :(
 - Cache all expensive stuff once..
 - Add internal whitelisting for some snaps due to not being able to easily
   list snaps in the remote store.
 - Prod upstream about supporting categories (top 50 in each) and having a way
   to show all within a category + range.
